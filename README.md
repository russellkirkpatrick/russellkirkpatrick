🎓 I completed my B.S in CS at Pitt in 2025.

🏙 Philadelphia native, with a passion for Software Engineering and creative problem solving.
 
💻 I am relocating to New York City now that I've graduated. I worked as a fullstack SWE at eServices and have 3 years of hands-on startup experience.

✈ In my free time, I like skiing, climbing, and all things music. 

⚙️ I build software with a focus on minimalism. Creativity is the driving factor in all aspects of my life and career.
